# Scenarios and Use Cases

Wikibox has a hugh potential for practical usage scenarios:

1. This comes by the fact that it was designed to be flexible enough mimic the behavior of traditional index cards (Pile of Index Cards), web blogs, wikis, hierarchical folders, sticky boards, lossy tagged notes collections and last but note least old school web 2.0 personal homepages with widgets (like iGoogle or netvibes).

2. WikiBox combines all advantages of plaintext files (markdown, txt, etc.) with attachments (pdfs, xls, doc, etc.) and version control by git. Most importantly you own your data. Your data is saved in a future-proof format. Your data is historicized so every stated can be reclaimed. You can put your data in an encrypted container (image).

3. At every time your data can be accessed through your file system and therefor can be viewed and manipulated by other applications. If you store your data in dropbox you even can access via web or [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). If you store it on github then you can manipulate it via web apps like [Grit](http://grit.rubyforge.org/), [Grit Github](https://github.com/mojombo/grit) or [Prose](http://prose.io/), [Prose Github](https://github.com/prose/prose).
