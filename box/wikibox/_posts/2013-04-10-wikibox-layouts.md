### (Web) Application (Fullscreen/Focus/Study Mode)

The full screen view of the application, helps to focus and shows nearly only one Index Card is shown nearly at fullscreen (without unecessary meta information). The card content is scrollable inside. without rearranging the other elements.

A good learning card has just the amount of information so that scrolling is not necessary.
With simple shortcuts (j/k or up/down arrow) the student can switch cards.

	|Field/Box|v|________|SEARCH| TIMER
								 
	|---------------------------| |-------|
	|			Title			| |Preview|	// Last Card
	|		Card Content 		| |-------|
	|							| ||-----||
	|							| ||Prev.||	// Current Card
	|		Current Card		| ||-----||
	|							| |-------|
	|							| |Preview|	// Next Card
	|							| |-------|
	|							| |-------|
	|							| |Preview|	
	|---------------------------| |-------|

**Elements**

- Content Area: One Index Card is shown nearly at fullscreen (without unecessary meta information).
- (optional) The Command Bar lets enter commands, highlight text, search, filter for cards.
- (optional) A minimal timer shows the current time and a pomodoro counter (graphical hourglass, disc, circle).
- A small sidebar shows the stream of cards in this box. The cards only show the title and card content. They are displayed as little thumbnails (similar to Mac Preview App for a document with several pages). The current card from the main content is highlighted (e.g. framed blue). The last viewed (1 or 2 cards) and next (complete stack) viewed cards are visible (chronically).

## Page Layouts

### Board and Area Page
 
A board page has several columns/slots, in which cards can be placed (2 Dimensions). 

	X	X	X	X	X
	X	X	X		X	
	X	X			X	
		X			X
		X

Columns can be:

- a complete box of cards.
- a random stack of cards.

Semantic Differences between a Board and a Area:

- A area is a persistent container for boxes and stacks, that are fixed to a field or supercatgory (e.g. Work).
- A board is a temporary collection for boxes and stacks, that might includ a lot of movement (e.g. Kanban or Scrum Board).

### Box and Stack Pages

A box or a stack page is a single column or stream of cards (1 Dimension).

	\/
	/\
	\/
	/\
	\/
	/\

Semantic Differences of a Box and a Stack.

- A box serves as persistent container (storage) for cards, that are tightly coupled by a specific attribute.
- A stack is a temporary collection (bundle) of cards, that are only loosely connected for a period of time.

### Card Page

Here a single card is rolled out (Focused View).
