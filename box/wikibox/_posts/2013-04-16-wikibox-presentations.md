# Making Presentations Fun Again

**Layout**

For Presentation View (Card Page) see Wikibox Layout Specification.

**Character of markdown presentations**

It is supposed to be much quicker in creating and manipulating content then your typical presentation program and thus replaces the need for propriety formats like Microsoft Powerpoint `.ppsx` `.pptx`, Apple Keynote `.keynote`, and open formats like LibreOffice or NeoOffcie or Apache OpenOffice Impress `.odp` `.otp` `.sdd` `.sxi`, which make highly use of slow mouse interactions.

**Viewing a Presentation**

The html can be viewed on any mobile or tablet device, too. Attachments can be included with relative links.

**Sharing of Presentations**

Sharing the single html file with css and javascript included makes presentations much more fun. For example mathjax, syntax highlighting or animated graphics can now be included as interactive elements, as well as links to attached external files.

**Sharing Formats**

Sharing is supposed to be done in one of these ways. 
1. As single .html file.  
2. As a zipped folder. Illustrated below.  

	.
	|-- Presentation.zip
		|-- Presentation Folder
			|-- presentation.html 		// presentation
			|-- presentation.pdf 		// printed presentation
			|-- attachment.pdf 			// other pdfs
			|-- attachment.doc 			// other documents
			|-- attachment.java			// code snippets
